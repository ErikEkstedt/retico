# LM Prediction Experiment


we want to build chatbots and spoken dialog systems. We want to do this because speech is the natural way for humans to interact and effect things in the world without directly doing it. Only a very few percentagee of human have the resources to hire people to this for them. Personal assistants that handles your calendar, direct contact with experts, customized personal shopping assistants, personal chefs, etc are all examples of services available for a minute part of the human race. 

Todays society sees an ever increasing rate of things being automated. Digital calendars, recommendation systems for searches, movies, music, shopping, meal recepies help us choose what to buy or spend our time on. Self driving cars, automatic vacuum cleaners, washing machines, dishwashers and even automatic cooking are a small sample of daily things which will be done by autonomous machines in the future. 

All these products are developed in parallel and rely on very similar technologies. The information age with its interconnectivity and more powerful machine learning systems have boosted the rate of progress in all these areas where basic instructions program have failed to deliver. The automation of a wide array of every day chores will come sooner than we might expect.

Given this avalanche of new automated products there is the added complexity of control. How can one person control all automated assistants available to them? The simplest solution would be to have one single application UI connected to all different assistants with an easy way to navigate between all the different services. However, one can imagine that this comes with a high cognitive load and might even take too much of our, ever decreasing, attention span that many people might even opt out of automating as many things as they possibly could.

Having an application with 1000 different settings for 10s of different systems is just not something most people wish to add into their lifes. To have a structured array of settings, like an interactive remote control of your life, may sound cool but could for many people be undesireable. There is the demographics of technologically preficient people which would warmly embrace this prospect but a vastly larger proportion would just find it impossible to use.

As humans we are not evolved to keep track of long lists of settings and to traverse structured list, however easy the actual traversing is (i.e a swipe or a button press). As human we evolved to control all things of which we do not directly do through our language. In a sense that is precicely what human language is all about. The ability to, at least in theory, control events beyond are horizon of activity. Through speech we describe how we want things to be done, what we want, what we expect of others, we cooperate with eachother, report about events outside of others horizon of activity, and much more. Given this fact it is easy to see that what most people would prefer in general would be to use human language to control all the automated aspects of our life.

The vast majority of humans are able to use language in order to communicate, learn new things, explain things to others, and in general effect aspects of their daily life in confluence with their wants and needs. The events where such confluence is not possible (moments where you can not effect the world to your liking) stand out and serve as important places where we may compromise and cooperate from anothers liking. It is difficult to list all aspects of ones life that is effected by ones ability to communicate, from simple chore coordination in your home to grocery shopping to work life etc.

This coordinated communication is vastly dependent on the "to and fro" aspect of conversation. A personal one on one explanation from an experts is considerably more valuable than a free lecture on the internet (which is better than reading a book, which is better than to learn everything from scratch). The vital component of the one on one interaction comes from the ability to quickly update eachother about ones thinking aided by the ability to repair missunderstandings. This makes the information transfer between 2 (or more) humans greater than without these abilities.

This interactional aspect of language is arguably the base usecase for the human language precedes the written (stored) forms of human language by far. Human language is not only interactional in its core but it's also the way that all humans learn how to do it, and how most people best learn new things. The actual information content of what we like to happen might be the distinct reason for it being realized but the interactional aspect is the funnel, space, dynamics, pattern of which this information is transmitted.

These interactional patterns are engrained in the human race and are general across different cultures, languages and dialects. These interactional patterns is the basis for the research area of turn-taking. Turn-taking is simply a general term which refers to the way of which humans organize their turns, who is speaking and when. When a person gets a 1o1 interaction with another they feel that they are heard and understood, the can ask about specific information they personally lack and show where the don't understand and quickly update the information transferred by the other.

The problem of utilizing the automated personal assistants of the future is not only a question about understanding the settings of the remote control of our life but to actually learn these setting and understand how they will influence your life. 

In short I describe a plausable direction of the future of human daily life related to the automation of all the things you rather not do your self.  Because these system will handle stuff in everyones personal daily lifes there is a vital aspect of who is in control of these systems. A personalized assistant that helps you, should only be controlled by you, and not some other entity which may have diverging interests in your life compared to your own. However, the ability to control these systems is not only a question of having "admin rights" over the control application but to actually understand it. I will add that being able to use as many automated assistants as fluently as possible gives an advantage and if these technologies are not easily accesable to as many people as possible there is a risk of societal and economic disparity. 

The question then becomes how we may provide a way to give as many humans as possible the ability to use and control their assistants. Now the hardest problem is for people to learn how to control these system, learn what they can do and learn how they can change what they do. The RCOYL with a 1000 buttons and a huge manual of all technological aspect of the system is not going to be the way that most people learn how to use these systems. Instead most humans should learn how they work, as they learn about most other things, through interaction.

The RCOYL, standing in for the most common ways to control things today, is interactive. You can tweak the setting, compare performance, and repeat. The downside is that this interaction is not something many people would enjoy, seems quite boring. However, if the interaction was structured as a conversation where the system can ask you what you want, recommend things to try, available to have a 'to and fro' conversation the usage might be considerably more fun. If not fun per say, I can think of many more fun things to do, at least it is an interaction common to our every day experience adding as little extra cognitive load and activities to our life. This interaction is important because it is through use over time that humans most easily learn something new. The RCOYL is different than conversation and is easily labelled as 'the annoying thing you have to do in order to use the great technologies' and something that then will stand in your way to actually learn the power available to you.

Humans have an intrinsic affinity towards speech. Put two people that don't know eachother in the same space most often than not some form of communication is initialized (dependent on the context). Small talk is something that we are all familiar with and is something that simply happen if humans are in close proximity and free of chores. Given that an computational system become sufficient enough of following the patterns of conversation for successful, non-cognitive demanding small talk, humans will interact with these system automatically over time. The added information available to such a system could then be sent better and more often to the people that owns it, teaching them more about how it works and can learn more about how the user works. It is through constant usage that these tools may learn to transfer information in such a way as to maximize the utility of individual users.

Of course further speculation takes us to the point were these intelligent personal interfaces becomes a filter for most information about the world the user takes in. What happened in the wordl (news), what does a word mean (wikipedia), who won the game, who is that, is this information source reliable, "I don't understand what these people mean, tell me in other words", and the list goes on. All of these more distant capabilities will largely depend on the content of language more than the way of transmitting it. Turn-taking, the aspect or pattern of how we most naturally parse information is not the end-goal but it can be one of the first step we need to fill in order to get further progress.

##### Summary

* Humans are speaking creatures, we can't help ourselves from conversing.
* Humans effect events outside of their horizon of activity indirectly through speech.
* Humans learn language through conversation.
* Humans learn new information through conversation and repetition.
* The future will automate most aspects of everyday life.
* Automation of the aspect of ones life that one does not want to do is very valuable. Time is all anyone has.
* Automation gives a competitive edge. People that can use technologically advance system have an edge.
* Access to and control of the automation in your life is important.
* Control is highly correlated to knowledge.
* The knowledge should be accessable to as many as possible.
* The future of communicating with automation through natural language is desired.
* Humans are all EXPERTS at conversation and therefore is the space where we give most people the best initial condition for sufficient access with automation.
* The 'to and fro' component of conversation is vital for enjoyment and repeated use.
* **Turn-taking** is the 'to and fro'.
* A system with 'real' chit-chat capabilites could be the aspect which maximizes repeated interaction.
* The 'real' part of chit-chat lies in the dynamics and not the content of conversation. (as a first step)
* The repeated interaction will feel consistent with every day human life.
* The repeated interaction maximize learning of and familiarity with the automation systems.
* A world where an uneducated grandparent feels that they have as much control as an educated programmer, in regards to tecknology, is a good world.
* Automation is well underway and it is vital that as many people as possible reap the benefits.

Should be mentioned
* Natural synthetic voices is very important
* Natural synthetic gestures is very important
* Natural facial gestures and 'actions' (smiling) is important
* Knowledge of content is important

## Turn-taking as a science

Turn-taking, the inter-personal flow of a conversation, is globally to organize the turns of a conversation and individually to decide when to speak and when to listen.

* Conversation can be seen as an entity. The Global view.
* Conversation can be seen as the emergent phenomena of two (or more) individual processes. The personal view.










## Appendix

---------------------------------

* horizon of activity: like the horizon of the observable universe or the boundary of black holes human have a locality in space and a boundary, outside of which, we can't directly effect the world.
* one on one, 1o1: The focused interaction/dialog between to humans. High degree of attention of the state of the other and the content of dialog. Energy is spent on understanding the intent, meaning and missing information of the other. Energy is spent on organizing ones own speech to match these prediction in a way as close to ones own intentions and meaing.
